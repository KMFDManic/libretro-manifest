repo manifest for libretro project

This is an alternative method to libretro-fetch.sh for getting/keeping libretro project code up to date which may intigrate better with some devs' workflows. It allows for a local manifest file so that devs can re-map or add specific repositories in the libretro project with their personal working versions of that repository without imacting the mapping of any of the other community repositories.

### Setup and initial run
Instead of cloning libretro-super and then running libretro-fetch.sh do the following:

Make sure you have a bin/ directory in your home directory and that it is included in your path:
```bash
mkdir ~/bin
PATH=~/bin:$PATH
```
Download the Repo tool and ensure that it is executable:
```bash
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```
Grab all the libretro projects:
```bash
mkdir ~/libretro-src
cd ~/libretro-src
repo init -u https://github.com/libretro/libretro-manifest.git
repo sync
repo forall -c git submodule update --init
```

### Subsequent runs (keep your local code up to date)
```bash
cd ~/libretro-src
repo sync
repo forall -c git submodule update
```
